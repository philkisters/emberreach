# Tales of Emberreach

I wanted to dive deeper into Nuxt and what is a better way then trying to create a fun browsergame. 

Tales of Emberreach is a web-based cooperative game for 4â€“6 players who build and expand a shared settlement. Through active tasks, crafting, and role specialization, the group gradually develops the village over days and weeks. The goal is collaborative progress, coordination, and responding to dynamic events.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash

```

## Production

Build the application for production:

# npm
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
